# User Guide

Welcome to the PolyglotMol User Guide! This guide is designed to walk you through every major functionality that PolyglotMol offers, from working with molecular datasets to using different types of molecular representations.

PolyglotMol is built with flexibility and modularity in mind, supporting a wide range of data formats, representation methods, and learning models. Whether you're new to molecular machine learning or an experienced researcher looking to prototype novel representations, you'll find helpful resources and practical examples here.

Each section of this guide corresponds to a core component of the toolkit. Start with the basics, then dive into data handling, model interfaces, and our multi-modal representation system.
