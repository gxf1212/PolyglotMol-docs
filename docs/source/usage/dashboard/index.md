## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dashboard Dependencies

```bash
# Install with dashboard extras
pip install polyglotmol[dashboard]

# Or install manually
pip install streamlit plotly scipy
```

### 2. Run Screening

```python
from polyglotmol.models.api import universal_screen

results = universal_screen(
    dataset=dataset,
    target_column="activity",
    enable_db_storage=True  # Creates SQLite database
)
# Results saved to: screening_results.db
```

- NumPy for metric calculations
- 100x faster than Python loops

**Lazy Loading:**
- Pagination for large tables
- Progressive chart rendering
- Spinners for user feedback

**Memory Management:**
- JSON serialization for cache keys
- Garbage collection after tab switches
- Efficient DataFrame operations

## Navigation Guide

**Sidebar:**

- Quick statistics
- Filter controls

**Main Area:**
- Tab navigation (large, clear labels)
- Chart containers with titles
- Interactive visualizations
- Export buttons

**Tips:**

- Right-click charts for save options
- Refresh browser to reload data

## Common Use Cases

### Finding the Best Model

1. Launch dashboard: `polyglotmol view results.db`
2. Check **Performance Analysis** tab → Overview cards
3. Look at **Model Comparison** chart → Identify top models
4. Switch to **Model Inspection** tab → Search for best model
5. Review prediction scatter plot and residuals
6. Export model parameters and reproduction code

### Comparing Representation Families

1. Go to **Performance Analysis** tab
2. View **Representation Analysis** chart (grouped by modality)
3. Switch metrics (R², RMSE, Kendall τ) to see consistency
4. Note which modalities perform best
5. Export filtered results for top representations

### Debugging Poor Performance

1. Go to **Distribution Analysis** tab
2. Select box plot chart type
3. Group by model type
4. Identify models with high variance or low medians
5. Switch to **Model Inspection** → Search failing models
6. Check residual plots for systematic bias

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard won't start:**
```bash
# Check dependencies
pip install streamlit plotly scipy

# Try specific port
polyglotmol view results.db --port 8503

# Check file exists
ls -lh results.db
```

**No results displayed:**
- Verify file contains data: `sqlite3 results.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM model_results;"`
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Try loading from JSON: `polyglotmol view results.json`

**Slow performance:**
- Reduce displayed results with filters
- Clear browser cache
- Use pagination for large tables
- Close other Streamlit apps

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:8502 | xargs kill -9

# Or use different port
polyglotmol view results.db --port 8504
```

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Basic usage
polyglotmol view <path>

# Options
polyglotmol view <path> --port 8503  # Custom port
polyglotmol info                      # Package info
polyglotmol --help                    # Full help

# Examples
polyglotmol view ./results.db
polyglotmol view ./screening_results_20250115
polyglotmol view ../experiments/run1/results.json --port 8505
```
