# Basics

Fundamental concepts and usage patterns for working with PolyglotMol.

## Introduction

This section covers the essential building blocks you need to understand before diving into specific components of PolyglotMol. Whether you're just starting out or need a reference for core concepts, you'll find practical guides on the featurizer system, configuration management, and data representation formats.

Key topics include:
- **Featurizer System**: Understanding how to discover, instantiate, and use molecular and protein featurizers
- **Configuration**: Managing global settings, dependencies, and environment setup
- **Data Shapes & Modalities**: Understanding the different representation formats and their dimensions

## Quick Start

```python
import polyglotmol as pm

# List available featurizers
featurizers = pm.list_available_featurizers()
print(f"Available featurizers: {len(featurizers)}")

# Get a specific featurizer
featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("morgan_fp_r2_1024")

# Generate features
from rdkit import Chem
mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles("CCO")
features = featurizer.featurize(mol)
print(f"Feature shape: {features.shape}")
```
