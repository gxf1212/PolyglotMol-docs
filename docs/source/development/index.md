## Overview

PolyglotMol is designed with modularity, extensibility, and ease of use in mind. The codebase follows several key design principles:

- **Registry-Based Architecture**: Featurizers and models are registered dynamically
- **Lazy Loading**: Dependencies loaded only when needed
- **Modular Design**: High cohesion, low coupling between components
- **Dependency Management**: Unified system for optional dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints throughout

- {doc}`adding_features/models` - Add new ML models
- {doc}`adding_features/modalities` - Add new data modalities

## Development Philosophy

### Code Quality Over Speed
We prioritize maintainable, well-tested code over quick hacks. Every PR should:
- Include tests
- Follow style guidelines
- Update relevant documentation
- Pass CI checks

### User-Centric Design
Features should be intuitive for computational chemists and ML practitioners:
- Clear, descriptive names
- Sensible defaults
- Comprehensive error messages
- Rich documentation with examples

### Scientific Rigor
Implementations should be scientifically sound:
- Reference original papers
- Validate against known benchmarks
- Handle edge cases properly
- Document limitations

## Communication

- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions
- **Pull Requests**: Follow PR template and link related issues

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or have questions:

1. Check existing documentation
2. Search GitHub Issues
3. Ask in GitHub Discussions
4. Reach out to maintainers
