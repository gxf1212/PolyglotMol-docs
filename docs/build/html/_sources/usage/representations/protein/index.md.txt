# Protein Representations

This section describes how protein-level representations are handled in PolyglotMol. It is divided into two main submodules: `sequence` and `structure`. These handle features derived from the amino acid sequence and 3D structural data, respectively.

For now, only sequence-level features are implemented.

* `sequence`: Extract features from protein sequences using pretrained language models (PLMs).
* `structure`: Placeholder for future support of structural representations.
