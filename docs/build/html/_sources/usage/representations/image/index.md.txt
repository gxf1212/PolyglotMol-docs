# Image Representations

Generate diverse image-based molecular representations for deep learning applications. Convert molecular structures into 2D images, 3D voxel grids, video sequences, and more - all optimized for CNN processing.

## Dependencies

```bash
# Optional dependencies for specific features
pip install torch torchvision  # For CNN feature extraction  
conda install -c conda-forge pymol-open-source  # For high-quality 3D rendering
```

## Quick Start

```python
import polyglotmol as pm
import numpy as np

# Generate 2D molecular image
image_featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("rdkit_2d_image")
image = image_featurizer.featurize("CCO")  # Shape: (224, 224, 3)

# Extract CNN features from images  
cnn_featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("cnn_features_resnet")
features = cnn_featurizer.featurize("CCO")  # Shape: (2048,)

# Generate multi-channel chemical image
chemception = pm.get_featurizer("chemception_image") 
multi_image = chemception.featurize("CCO")  # Shape: (80, 80, 4)

# Create 3D voxel representation
voxel_featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("voxel_grid")
voxels = voxel_featurizer.featurize("CCO")  # Shape: (48, 48, 48, 8)
```

## Batch Processing Example

```python
# Process multiple molecules efficiently
molecules = ["CCO", "CCN", "CCC", "c1ccccc1"]

# Generate 2D images in parallel
featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("rdkit_2d_image")
images = featurizer.featurize(molecules, n_workers=4)
print(f"Generated {len(images)} images, each with shape {images[0].shape}")

# Combine with dataset
from polyglotmol.data import MolecularDataset, Molecule
dataset = MolecularDataset([Molecule(smi) for smi in molecules])
dataset.add_features("rdkit_2d_image")
dataset.add_features("cnn_features_resnet") 
```

## Integration with ML Pipelines

```python
# CNN training pipeline
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Generate training data
smiles_train = ["CCO", "CCN", "CCC"] * 100
labels_train = [0, 1, 0] * 100  # Binary classification

featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("rdkit_2d_image")
X = np.array(featurizer.featurize(smiles_train))
y = np.array(labels_train)

# Prepare for PyTorch (NCHW format)
X_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(X.transpose(0, 3, 1, 2)) / 255.0
y_tensor = torch.LongTensor(y)

# Create DataLoader
dataset = TensorDataset(X_tensor, y_tensor)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
print(f"Training data shape: {X_tensor.shape}")  # (300, 3, 224, 224)
```

## Performance Tips

```python
# Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
def process_in_chunks(smiles_list, chunk_size=1000):
    featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("rdkit_2d_image") 
    for i in range(0, len(smiles_list), chunk_size):
        chunk = smiles_list[i:i+chunk_size]
        yield featurizer.featurize(chunk, n_workers=8)

# Process 10K molecules in chunks
large_dataset = ["CCO"] * 10000
all_features = []
for chunk_features in process_in_chunks(large_dataset):
    all_features.extend(chunk_features)
```

## Error Handling

```python
# Robust batch processing with error handling
def safe_batch_featurize(smiles_list):
    featurizer = pm.get_featurizer("rdkit_2d_image")
    results = []
    failed = []
    
    for i, smiles in enumerate(smiles_list):
        try:
            result = featurizer.featurize(smiles)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Failed {smiles}: {e}")
            results.append(None)  # Placeholder
            failed.append(i)
    
    return results, failed

# Test with mixed valid/invalid SMILES
test_molecules = ["CCO", "INVALID", "CCN"]
images, failed_indices = safe_batch_featurize(test_molecules)
print(f"Successfully processed: {len(images) - len(failed_indices)}")
```
